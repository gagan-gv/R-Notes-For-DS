# Lists
- They act as containers
- Not restriced to single type of data in single list, i.e., can encompass mixture of data types
- Can be referred as a generic vector
- Can be nested
- Referenced by index using double square brackets
- Can be extremely useful inside functions such that it helps to return multiple objects

## Codes related to Lists
- Can be defined by list()
- Every element in a list is considered as a vector or in simple words list is a collection of vectors
```r
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 9L)
x
#output would look like the following
#[[1]]
#[1] 1
#
#[[2]]
#[1] "a"
#
#[[3]]
#[1] TRUE
#
#[[4]]
#[1] 9

x[2]#output -> "a" in a list format
x[[2]] #output -> "a" in a vector format

# To Nest: list(..., ,list(), ,...)

#To find class of each element with using loops can be done using lapply(X, class)
lapply(x, class) #output -> class of each element in a list format
```
### List Naming
- Order of naming doesn't matter it can be like a b c d or b a d c
```r
x <- list(a = "a", b = 2, c = c(1L,2L,3L), d = list(T,F,T))
x
#output as follows
#$a
#[1] "a"
#
#$b
#[1] 2
#
#$c
#[1] 1 2 3
#
#$d
#$d[[1]]
#[1] TRUE
#
#$d[[2]]
#[1] FALSE
#
#$d[[3]]
#[1] TRUE

# To access list elements via name, we do list name $ list element name
x$a #output-> "a"
```
