### Tibbles
- A tidyverse package
- Can be called modern dataframes
- Does Less, Complains more, i.e, forces you to confront problems
- Leads to cleaner more expressive code
- Comes with enhanced print() thus making it easier to use large datasets containing complex objects
- Any function working with dataframes will work with tibbles
- #### Tibbles: The simple data frame?
  - Never changes type of inputs
  - Never changes the names of variables
  - Never create row names
  - Possible column names are available i.e., can rename column other than respective variable name and with variable rule bending by surroung then with backticks(`)

### Transposed Tibble or tribble
- function name tribble()
- customised for data entry in code like column headings defined by formulae or seperated by commas
- Makes it possible to lay out small amount of data in easy to read form
- Comes with refined print()
  - Shows only first 10 rows
  - Shows all columns that fit on the screen
  - Makes it easier to work with large data
  - Each column reports its name and type which is similar to str() in dataframes

### How to convert to a tibble
```r
library(tibble)
as_tibble(iris) #iris is predeined data frame or data package in R and as_tibble converts dataframe to tibble
```
### How to define a tibble
- As tibble is modern Data Frame it allows you to give uneven length of vectors as input and then it matches the length automatically
- You can have columns as arithmetics of other columns
- You can name your columns anything like emojis(the one made with keyboard combinations), invalid combination of characters, etc
```r
library(tibble)
tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  ` ` = 6,
  `;)` = x + ` `
) #output would be as follows
#x y ;)
#1 6 7
#2 6 8
#3 6 9
#4 6 10
#5 6 11 
```
### Transposed Tibble or Tribble
- Anything followed by tint(~) is the name of the column
```r
library(tibble)
tribble(~x, ~y, ~z, "a", T, 3.6, "1", F, 5)
#output as follows
# x y     z
# a TRUE  3.6
# 1 FALSE 5
```
