# Matrices
- Extension of numeric/character data types
- It's not a seperate type object
- An atomic vector with dimension
- Fill column wise by default
- Referenced by index respective of each dimension in single square matrix

## Codes related to Matrices
- Can create a matrix using matrix(data=, nrow=, ncol= byrow=, dimnames=)
  - data = is the data to be filled in matrix, default is NA
  - nrow, ncol = No. of rows and columns respectively, default is 1
  - byrow = How to fill the matrix, i.e., by row or by column, default is FALSE so it fills by column
  - dimnames = To name rows and columns, default is NULL
```r
x <- matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
x
#Output as follows
#1 2
#3 4
#5 6
y <- matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
y
#output as follows
#1 4
#2 5
#3 6

#dim() is used to find dimension of matrix
dim(x) #output ->3 2
# To change dimension of matrix do the following
dim(x) <- c(2,3)
x
#output as follows
#1 2 3
#4 5 6

#To convert vectors to matrices we can use cbind or rbind
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(4,5,6)
z <- cbind(a,b)
#output as follows
#1 4
#2 5
#3 6
# NOTE: when using cbind the columns get the name of vectors variables
rbind(a,b)
#output as follows
#1 2 3
#4 5 6
# NOTE: when using rbind the rows get the name of vector variables

#Check colnames using colnames() and row names using rownames()

z[1, 1:3] #output would be 1st row completely
```
