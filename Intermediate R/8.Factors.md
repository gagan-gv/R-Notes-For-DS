# Factors
- They are an advanced data type
- Used to handle categorical variables, like having fixed, limited and known value set
- Can store both strings and integers(Not numeric)
- Useful for statistical modeling
- E.g., Gender, Logical(T/F), Directions
- We use factor() to convert the data to a factor
- Levels in a factor are basically the identity given to them

```r
data <- c("East", "West", "East","North", "North", "East", "South")
data_factor <- factor(data)
data_factor
#output as follows
#East  West  East  North North East  South
#Levels: East North South West

levels(data_factor) #output -> "East" "North" "South" "West"
as.integer(data_factor) #output 1 4 1 2 2 1 3

sort(data_factor)
#output as follows
#East  East  East  North North South West 
#Levels: East North South West

#to give custom level sort
dataFactor <- factor(data, levels = c("East", "West", "North", "South"))
dataFactor
#output as follows
#East  West  East  North North East  South
#Levels: East West North South

table(dataFactor) #to view data in tabular format
#output as follows
#dataFactor
# East  West North South 
#    3     1     2     1 
```
# forcats
- A tidy verse package
- Provides a suite to handle/solve problems related to factors
- Common functions
  - fct_reorder() -> reorders factor by another variable
  - fct_infreq() -> reorders factor based on frequency values
  - fct_relevel() -> changing the order of a factor by hand
  - fct_lump() -> collapse least/most frequent values of a factor

```r
library(forcats)
fct_infreq(dataFactor) #output, have a look at the levels
#East  West  East  North North East  South
#Levels: East North West South
fct_relevel(dataFactor, "South") #output as follows
#East  West  East  North North East  South
#Levels: South East West North
```
