# Pipe Operator (%>%)
- Most important operator for data manipulation in R
- Provided by magrittr -> A tidyverse package
  - Used for:
    - structuring sequences of data operations left-to-right (as opposed to from the inside and out)
    - avoiding nested function calls
    - minimizing the need for local variables and function definitions
    - making it easy to add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations
  - Comes with almost all tidyverse packages
- Provides an alternative for supplying the first argument of a function
- In simple words, it acts as a link between the argument and the function, thus making the code reading easier, like if multiple functions are wrapped in one another then it's quite un readable and this operator beautifies it.

```r
#install.packages("magrittr")
library(magrittr)

# to calculate mean of first 10 natural numbers with pipe operator
1:10 %>% mean(.) #mean(1:10) 

#If we want to floor the above value
1:10 %>% mean(.) %>% floor(.) #floor(mean(1:10))
