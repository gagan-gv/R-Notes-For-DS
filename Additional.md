## *For Preprocessing*
### Train/Test
- Always split the data into training and test sets
- Must be done before preprocessing
- Common Splits:
  - 70:30
  - 80:20
- Test data can only be used once
- Ensure objective measurement for accuracy

### What is a model?
- The goal of a model is to provide a simple low dimensional summary of a dataset.
- Parts of model:
  - Define a family of models that expresses precise, yet general, patterns that you want to capture.
  - Generate a fitted model by finding a model from the family that is closest to your data.

## *For EDA*
### Types of variables
- Categorical: It's basically a set of values, like factors
- Continuous: It can take an infinite set of ordered values, like dates, numbers, etc.

### Other Values
- Unusual Values: They are outliers in the data
- Missing Values
