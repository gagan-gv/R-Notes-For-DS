# Functional Programming
## The apply() family
- apply(), lapply(), sapply(), mapply(), vapply()
- They are alternative to loops
- Better suited for data science
- lapply() is commonly used
- purrr, a tidyverse package is an alternative

### lapply()
- It applies a given function to every element of the list and returns a list as a result
- Can also be used with data frames or vectors
- It returns a list same number of objects passed in it
- Use unlist() to get the output in vector format

```r
x <- lapply(rep(2,2), runif) #would run 2 times gives a list of 2*2 output would vary for everyone as runif generates random values
x
#To find mean of the above randomly generated values
means <- lapply(x, mean) #output would be a list of 2 giving a mean for each list vector element
means

unlist(means) #output would be a vector of each value of means variable

lengthOfCarNames <- lapply(rownames(mtcars), nchar)
lengthOfCarNames
```
