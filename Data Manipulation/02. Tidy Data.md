# Tidy Data
A standard way of storing data, i.e, whenever possible like
- Ever column is a variable
- Every row is an observation
- Every cell is a single value

## Messy Data Examples
|   |                       |
|---|-----------------------|
| A | Hair: Black, Age: 20  |
| B | Hair: Brown, Age: 35  |
| C | Hair: Blonde, Age: 40 |

This is a messy data as second column has multiple values and also has multiple variables.

|   | Black | Brown | Blonde |
|---|-------|-------|--------|
| A | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE  |
| B | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE  |
| C | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE   |

This is also considered as a messy data black, brown and blonde refer to a single variable (Hair Colour) but have been shown as multiple variables.

| Black | Brown | Blonde |
|-------|-------|--------|
| A     | B     | C      |

This is also considered as a messy data as the row doesn't show a single observation, it shows 3 different observation.
