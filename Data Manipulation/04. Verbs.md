## dplyr
- Most important package for Data Manipulation
- Major Functions under dplyr:
  - filter(): Pick cases based on their values (Selecting rows)
  - select(): Pick variables based on their names (Selecting columns)
  - mutate(): Adds new variables as functions of existing variables (Add/Change columns)
  - arrange(): Change the ordering of the rows
  - summarize(): Reduce multiple values to a single summary

## Filter Verb
```r
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# We will be using starwars dataset. This is comes together with dplyr package.

#filtering with single constraint
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo") # filtering all rows based on variable homeworld with value Naboo

#filtering with multiple constraints
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo", eye_color != "orange") # filtering all rows based n variable homeworld with value Naboo and where eye color is not orange
```
