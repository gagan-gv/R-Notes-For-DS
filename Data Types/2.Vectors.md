# Vectors
- Only Holds data of single type
- Can hold only common data types
- R supports missing data in vectors as NA which can be used for all data types
- Special Values
    Inf: Infinity
    NaN: Not a Number or undefined value

## Codes related to vectors
- A vector can be created using vector() or c()
- You can check a class of each vector too.
```r
vector(mode = "character", length = 10) #output -> "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "", as "" is default value
vector(mode = "numeric", length = 5) #output -> 0 0 0 0 0, as 0 is default value
vector(mode = "integer", length = 5) #output -> 0 0 0 0 0, as 0 is default value
vector(mode = "logical", length = 5) #output -> FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE, as FALSE is default value
vector(mode = "character", 5) == character(5) #output -> TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

character(2) #output -> "" ""
numeric(2) #output -> 0 0
integer(2) #output -> 0 0
logical(2) #output -> FALSE FALSE

c(1,2) #output -> 1 2 NOTE: Works similarly for all data types
length(c(1,2,3)) #output -> 3 Gives length of vector
str(c(1,2,3)) #output -> num [1:3] 1 2 3 i.e., it gives structural summary

#if you want to generate a vector sequence for eg 1-10 you can do it using ':' like 1:5 where output -> 1,2,3,4,5 or you can use seq() like seq(1,5) giving the same output
#To get a seq of even numbers one can do seq(2,10,2) syntax(from=, to=, by=)

#Concatenation of Vectors, consider 2 vectors x and y as follows
x <- 1:3
y <- 4:7
z <- c(x,y) # vectors get concatenated here and can be done similarly for n vectors
z #output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
### Vector Arithmetics
```r
#consider a vector x <- c(1,2,3) and y <- c(4,5)
x + 5 #output -> 6,7,8 basically adds a vector of dimension 1 row and 3 columns of element 5
x + y #output -> 5,7,7 adds the first 2 columns of both vectors and to maintain dimension it the lower dimension vector repeats it self

#similarly all arithmetic operations or PEDMAS or BODMAS operations are performed
```
### Vectors Dealing with Missing Values (NA)
```r
x <- c(5, NA, 0.25) #This is of type numeric and goes the same for all basic data types

# To check if a value is NA or Not we use is.na()
is.na(NA) #output-> TRUE
is.na(x) #output -> FALSE, TRUE, FALSE

# To check if there exists a NA value in a vector we use anyNA()
anyNA(x) #output -> TRUE
```

### Vector Coercion
```r
# Refer Notes from the theory file for Coercion
class(c(TRUE, 2 )) #output -> numeric ... Why? Because of implicit coercion TRUE is converted to 1 if FALSE it would be converted to zero
class(c("a", TRUE)) #output -> character ... due to implicit coercion

#Order of coercion character > numeric > integer > logical
```
### Vector Element Naming
- Done using names()
```r
#consider a vector x as c(1,2,3,4,5) and if you want a key value pair of this vector you can do it as follows
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
names(x) <- LETTERS[1:length(x)] 
x
#2 line output as follows
#A B C D E
#1 2 3 4 5
names(x) #output -> A B C D E

#NOTE: As there are only 26 LETTERS(A-Z) or letters(a-z), after 26 indices it will give NA as the name of vector element
#Also never consider this as a matrix

#ALTERNATIVE METHOD is while creating the vector
y <- c("a"=0, "b"=1)
names(y) #output-> a b
```
