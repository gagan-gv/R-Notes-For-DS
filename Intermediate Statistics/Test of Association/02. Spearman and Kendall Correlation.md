# Spearman and Kendall Correlation
- Both of these correlations are non parametric

```r
library(readr)
hw <- read_csv('hw.csv')
cor.test(hw$height, hw$weight, method = 'spearman', conf.level = 0.90, exact = F)
#exact stands for a logical indicating whether an exact p-value should be computed. Sometimes p-value cannot be calculated so, exact should be set to F
```
