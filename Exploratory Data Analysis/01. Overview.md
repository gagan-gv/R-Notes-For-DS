# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) - Overview
## What is EDA?
- Helps to develop an understanding of data
- Pushes you to ask questions
- It's a creative process

## Basic Definitions (Check Additional section too)
- Variable: A property that can be measured.
- Value: State of a variable when you measure it.
- Observation: A set of measurements, several values each associated with a different variable.
- Tabular Data: A set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data may be tidy.

## Variation
- The tendency of the values to change from measurement to measurement.
- Each measurement will include a small amount of error that varies measurement to measurement.
- Every variable has its own pattern of variation.
- The best way to understand variation is by visualizing it.

## Covariation
- Variation: The behaviour within a variable
- Covariation: The behaviour between 2 or more variables that vary in a related way
  - Best way to spot covariation is by visualizing the relationship
  - How covariation visualization depends on variables:
    - Categorical VS Continuous (Density, box, frequency, violin, etc)
    - Categorical VS Categorical (Bar, pie charts, etc)
    - Continuous VS Continuous (Scatter plot, etc)
