# Lists
- They act as containers
- Not restriced to single type of data in single list, i.e., can encompass mixture of data types
- Can be referred as a generic vector
- Can be nested
- Referenced by index using double square brackets
- Can be extremely useful inside functions such that it helps to return multiple objects

## Codes related to Lists
- Can be defined by list()
- Every element in a list is considered as a vector or in simple words list is a collection of vectors
```r
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 9L)
x
```

```r
# To Nest: list(..., ,list(), ,...)

#To find class of each element with using loops can be done using lapply(X, class)
lapply(x, class)
```

### List Naming
- Order of naming doesn't matter it can be like a b c d or b a d c
```r
x <- list(a = "a", b = 2, c = c(1L,2L,3L), d = list(T,F,T))
x
```

```r
# To access list elements via name, we do list name $ list element name
x$a
```
