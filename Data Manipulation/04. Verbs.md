# Verbs
- Verbs are part of **Grammar of Data Manipulation which provide consitent set**
- They are used to solve most common data manipulation challenges
- Types:
  - Filter Verb
  - Select Verb
  - Mutate Verb
  - Arrange Verb
  - Summarize Verb

## dplyr
- Most important package for Data Manipulation
- Major Functions under dplyr for verbs:
  - filter(): Pick cases based on their values (Selecting rows)
  - select(): Pick variables based on their names (Selecting columns)
    - Helper functions:
      - everything(): selects all the columns
      - last_col(): Select last variable, possibly with an offset
      - starts_with(): Starts with a prefix
      - ends_with(): Ends with a suffix
      - contains(): Contains a literal string
      - matches(): Matches a regular expression
      - num_range(): Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
      - all_of(): Matches variable names in a character vector. All names must be present, otherwise an out-of-bounds error is thrown
      - any_of(): Same as all_of(), except that no error is thrown for names that don't exist
      - where(): Applies a function to all variables and selects those for which the function returns TRUE
  - mutate(): Adds new variables as functions of existing variables (Add/Change columns)
    - Helper functions:
      - across(): Used to select multiple rows at once to mutate
      - For other helper functions <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">Mutate under dplyr </a>
  - arrange(): Change the ordering of the rows
  - summarize(): Reduce multiple values to a single summary

## Getting Started
```r
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

## Filter Verb
```r
# We will be using starwars dataset. This is comes together with dplyr package.

#filtering with single constraint
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo") # filtering all rows based on variable homeworld with value Naboo

#filtering with multiple constraints
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo", eye_color != "orange") # filtering all rows based on variable homeworld with value Naboo and where eye color is not orange
```

## Select Verb
```r
# To select a single column
starwars %>% select(., 2) #will show all the values in second column including its header.

# To select a range of columns
starwars %>% select(., 8:13) # will show all the values in 8th to 13th row including their headers

#To select specific columns
starwars %>% select(., c(1,3,5,7,9)) 

# To select specific rows in a specific order
starwars %>% select(., c(7,3,5,1,9))

#One can also extract columns without giving vectors as an argument
starwars %>% select(., 2,4,5,6)

#To extract data with unknown index numbers
starwars %>% select(., which(colnames(.) == "name"): which(colnames(.) == "species")) #This extract data from column "name" to column "species" where the which() calculates the index number

#To extract data by column names
starwars %>% select(., name:species) #This extract data from column "name" to column "species"

#To extract data by column names by removing unrequired columns
starwars %>% select(., name:species, -mass) #This extract data from column "name" to column "species" without the mass column

# To extract data and to keep other columns to the output but pushing them to the last
starwars %>% select(., mass:eye_color, everything()) #This will show all the columns but mass to eye_color would be given preference and would be placed at the start

#To extract data without specific columns which share common suffix
starwars %>% select(., !ends_with("color")) #This will show all the columns which don't end with color

#To extarct data with specific columns which share common suffix
starwars %>% select(., ends_with("color"))#This will show all the columns which ends with color

#To extract data with specific column which share common prefix
starwars %>% select(., starts_with("s"))#This will show all the columns which starts with s
```

## Mutate Verb
```r
# Creating another column
df <- starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2)) # this creates a column named bmi
df

#Changing a column
df %>% mutate(., bmi = round(bmi, 1)) #this would round the bmi column to tenths and override the existing column

#doing the above 2 processes in 1 step
starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2), bmi = round(bmi, 1)) 

#Trying mutate with filter verb
starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2), bmi = round(bmi, 1)) %>% filter(., bmi > 26 & bmi < 30) #this would create a row called bmi and select only those rows where bmi > 26 and < 30

#Trying to mutate and select with filter verb
starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2), bmi = round(bmi, 1)) %>% filter(., bmi >26 & bmi <30) %>% select(., name, height, mass) #this would create a row called bmi and select only those rows where bmi > 26 and < 30 and print only the name, height and mass

#Creating more than 1 columns
starwars %>% select(name, birth_year) %>% mutate(., birth_year2 = birth_year*5, birth_year2squared = birth_year2^2) #this would create 2 columns birth_year2 and birth_year2squared and will show name, birth_year, birth_year2 and birth_year2squared

# Across helper function
starwars %>% select(name, homeworld, species) %>% mutate(., across(c(homeworld, species), as.factor))
```
