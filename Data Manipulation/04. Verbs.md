# Verbs
- Verbs are **part of grammar of Data Manipulation which provide consistent set**
- They are used to solve most common data manipulation challenges
- Types:
  - Filter Verb
  - Select Verb
  - Mutate Verb
  - Arrange Verb
  - Summarize Verb

## dplyr
- Most important package for Data Manipulation
- Major Functions under dplyr for verbs:
  - filter(): Pick cases based on their values (Selecting rows)
  - select(): Pick variables based on their names (Selecting columns)
    - Helper functions:
      - everything(): selects all the columns
      - last_col(): Select last variable, possibly with an offset
      - starts_with(): Starts with a prefix
      - ends_with(): Ends with a suffix
      - contains(): Contains a literal string
      - matches(): Matches a regular expression
      - num_range(): Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
      - all_of(): Matches variable names in a character vector. All names must be present, otherwise an out-of-bounds error is thrown
      - any_of(): Same as all_of(), except that no error is thrown for names that don't exist
      - where(): Applies a function to all variables and selects those for which the function returns TRUE
  - mutate(): Adds new variables as functions of existing variables (Add/Change columns)
    - Helper functions:
      - across(): Used to select multiple rows at once to mutate
      - For other helper functions check <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">Mutate under dplyr </a>
  - arrange(): Change the ordering of the rows
    - Helper function:
      - desc(): Helps in descending arrangement
  - summarize(): Reduce multiple values to a single summary
    - Helper Functions:
      - n(): Gives total number of rows
      - group_by(): It groups dataset based on a columns value

## Getting Started
```r
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

## Filter Verb
```r
# We will be using starwars dataset. This is comes together with dplyr package.

#filtering with single constraint
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo") # filtering all rows based on variable homeworld with value Naboo
```

```r
#filtering with multiple constraints
starwars %>% filter(., homeworld == "Naboo", eye_color != "orange") # filtering all rows based on variable homeworld with value Naboo and where eye color is not orange
```

```r
#Trying mutate with filter verb
starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2), bmi = round(bmi, 1)) %>% filter(., bmi > 26 & bmi < 30) #this would create a row called bmi and select only those rows where bmi > 26 and < 30
```

starwars %>% mutate(., bmi = mass/((height/100)^2), bmi = round(bmi, 1)) %>% filter(., bmi >26 & bmi <30) %>% select(., name, height, mass) #this would create a row called bmi and select only those rows where bmi > 26 and < 30 and print only the name, height and mass
```

```r
#Creating more than 1 columns
starwars %>% select(name, birth_year) %>% mutate(., birth_year2 = birth_year*5, birth_year2squared = birth_year2^2) #this would create 2 columns birth_year2 and birth_year2squared and will show name, birth_year, birth_year2 and birth_year2squared

## Summarize Verb
- Similar to summary() but gives required output
- Gives a data frame as an output
```r
mtcars %>% summarize(., meanMPG = mean(mpg)) #This will only give the mean of column named mpg in mtcars dataset
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60386381/124115585-9cbeee80-da8b-11eb-9803-99c8c975cb2a.png)
```r
# To get total rows in dataset
mtcars %>% summarize(., meanMPG = mean(mpg), rowCount = n())
```

```r
#To get summarize specific column based on other columns specific value.
mtcars %>% group_by(carb) %>% summarize(., meanMPG = mean(mpg), rowCount = n()) #This summarizes the mpg values based on unique values of carb
```
