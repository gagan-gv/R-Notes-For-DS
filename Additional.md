## Train/Test
- Always split the data into training and test sets
- Must be done before preprocessing
- Common Splits:
  - 70:30
  - 80:20
- Test data can only be used once
- Ensure objective measurement for accuracy

## What is a model?
- The goal of a model is to provide a simple low dimensional summary of a dataset.
- Parts of model:
  - Define a family of models that expresses precise, yet general, patterns that you want to capture.
  - Generate a fitted model by finding a model from the family that is closest to your data.
