# Measures of Centers
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Mid Range

## Mean
- Population Mean: 
  - Denoted by μ
  - Formula: Σx/N (N is total population)
  - Function in R: mean(x)
- Sample Mean: 
  - Denoted by x̄
  - Formula: Σx/n (n is sample population)
  - Function in R: mean(x)

## Median
- Rank the data in increasing order and then find the middle term. The middle value is the median

**Note: If the number of observations is odd the above can be applied but for even observations the average of middle two terms is taken.**

- Function in R: median(x)

## Mode
- The most repetitive term(s).

**Note: There is no direct function for mode in R.**
It can be done by:
- R Code:
```r
#Code for mode
xt <- table(x)
which(xt==max(xt))
# The upper value is the mode value and lower one is the count.
```

## Mid Range
- Average of largest and the smallest value
- Formula: (Largest value + Smallest value)/2
- R Code:
```r
(max(x) + min(x))/2
```

### Example
```r
x <- c(1,2,3,5,4,48,12,0,1)
meanX <- mean(x)
medianX <- median(x)
xt <- table(x)
modeX <- which(xt==max(xt))
rangeX <- (max(x) + min(x))/2
meanX
medianX
modeX
rangeX
```
