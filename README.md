## Basic syntax
- <- or = can be used as assignment operator
- '#' (without quotes) is used for comments
- to check a documentation of any predefined function one can use ? before the function name for e.g., ?mean() 
- R doesn't follow similar index conventions of other languages as the index value starts from 1 in R not 0 thus making it more real world application.
